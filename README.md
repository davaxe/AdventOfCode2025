# Advent of Code 2025 - Rust Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2025 challenges,
written in Rust. Each day's solution is organized into separate crates for
clarity and ease of navigation.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```plain
/AdventOfCode2025
|-- template
|-- day-01
|   |-- src
|   |   |-- lib.rs
|   |   |-- part1.rs
|   |   |-- part2.rs
|   |   |-- main.rs
|   |   |-- ...
|   |-- Cargo.toml
|-- day-02
|   |-- src
|   |   |-- lib.rs
|   |   |-- part1.rs
|   |   |-- part2.rs
|   |   |-- main.rs
|   |   |-- ...
|   |-- Cargo.toml
|-- ...
|-- Cargo.toml
|-- README.md
```

- Each day's solution resides in its own crate (e.g., `day-01`, `day-02`).
- Every day consist of two separate modules for the two parts.
- Additionally every day have four text files with all different inputs from.
- The `main.rs` file contains rust code for displaying result of part 1 and part
  2 respectively.

## Running the Solutions

Navigate to the root directory and execute the following command:

```bash
cargo run --bin day-XX
```

Replace `XX` with the date to run. Additionally, it is required to add the
puzzle input (from AOC) in a text file with name `input.txt` in the root of the
crate `day-XX`.
